3. Recommended next steps and support services
4. Positive outcomes with early, consistent intervention
5. Family's role in therapy success

Tone: Hopeful, collaborative, and supportive. You're a partner, not a judge.
```

**Therapist:** "Can you give me an example script?"

**Assistant:** 
```
Example Opening:
"Thank you for meeting with me today. We've completed a comprehensive 
assessment of [Child's Name], and I want to share our findings with you. 
We've identified some wonderful strengths and also some areas where we can 
provide targeted support to help [him/her] thrive in school and with peers..."
