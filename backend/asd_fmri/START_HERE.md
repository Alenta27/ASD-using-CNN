## 🔍 Quick Verification

After setup, verify everything works:

### ✅ Checklist

- [ ] Dependencies installed (no errors)
- [ ] Model files created (`asd_svm_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`)
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] Web page loads at http://localhost:5002
- [ ] Can upload a test file
- [ ] Prediction completes successfully
- [ ] Results display correctly

### 🧪 Quick Test

Use this test file:
```
d:\ASD\backend\ds000212\derivatives\preprocessed_data\sub-pixar001\
sub-pixar001_task-pixar_run-001_swrf_bold.nii.gz
```

Expected result: **ASD diagnosis** with confidence score

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Model not initialized"
**Solution**: Run `python train_and_save_model.py` first

### Problem: "Module not found"
**Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Problem: Port already in use
**Solution**: Stop other Flask apps or change port in `app_mri.py`

### Problem: Processing fails
**Solution**: Check file is valid .nii.gz format

**More help**: See `README_MRI_WEB_APP.md` troubleshooting section
