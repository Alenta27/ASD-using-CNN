# MRI-Based ASD Detection Web Application

## üß† Overview

This is a **self-contained Flask web application** for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) screening using functional MRI (fMRI) brain connectivity analysis. The application uses a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify brain scans as ASD or neurotypical (Control).

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Unique Endpoint**: `/predict_mri` - No conflicts with existing applications  
‚úÖ **Unique Template**: `mri_screener.html` - Separate from other interfaces  
‚úÖ **Independent Port**: Runs on port 5002 (existing apps use 5001)  
‚úÖ **Complete Pipeline**: Upload ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Predict ‚Üí Display results  
‚úÖ **Professional UI**: Modern, responsive web interface  
‚úÖ **Real-time Processing**: Analyzes brain connectivity patterns on-the-fly

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd d:\ASD\backend\asd_fmri
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Train and Save the Model

Before running the web application, you need to train the model:

```bash
python train_and_save_model.py
```

**What this does:**
- Loads fMRI data from `../ds000212/derivatives/preprocessed_data/`
- Extracts brain connectivity features using Harvard-Oxford Atlas
- Trains an SVM classifier with RBF kernel
- Saves the trained model (`asd_svm_model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`)
- Generates model metadata for reference

**Expected output:**
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Model not initialized" error

**Solution**:
```bash
# Train the model first
python train_and_save_model.py

# Then run the app
python app_mri.py
```

### Problem: "No module named 'nilearn'" error

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Problem: Port 5002 already in use

**Solution**: Edit `app_mri.py` and change the port:
```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5003, debug=True)  # Use different port
```

### Problem: File upload fails

**Possible causes**:
- File is not in `.nii` or `.nii.gz` format
- File is corrupted
- File exceeds 500 MB size limit
- File is not a valid fMRI scan

**Solution**: Ensure you're uploading a valid, preprocessed fMRI scan in NIfTI format

### Problem: Processing takes too long

**Expected behavior**: Processing typically takes 30-60 seconds

**If it takes longer**:
- Check server logs for errors
- Ensure the MRI file is properly formatted
- Verify sufficient system memory (at least 4GB RAM recommended)

## üîÑ Integration with Existing Applications

This application is designed to **run independently** alongside your existing applications:

| Application | Port | Endpoint | Template |
|------------|------|----------|----------|
| **Voice Detection** | 5001 | `/predict-voice` | N/A |
| **Image Detection** | N/A | Node.js backend | N/A |
| **MRI Detection** | **5002** | **`/predict_mri`** | **`mri_screener.html`** |

**No conflicts**: Different ports, unique endpoints, and separate template names ensure complete independence.
