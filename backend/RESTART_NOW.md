# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Restart Required

## Changes Applied

1. ✅ **Fixed ObjectId creation** - Now properly converts teacher ID to ObjectId
2. ✅ **Added detailed error logging** - Will show specific error messages
3. ✅ **Improved error handling** - Better validation error messages

## CRITICAL: You Must Restart Your Server

The changes will NOT work until you restart the backend server.

### How to Restart:

1. **Go to your backend terminal**
2. **Press `Ctrl+C`** to stop the server
3. **Run `npm start`** to start it again
4. **Wait for** "Server listening on port 5000"
5. **Try adding a student again**

## What Will Happen After Restart

- If there are errors, you'll see them in the console with details
- The frontend will receive specific error messages instead of "Server error"
- Adding students should work properly

**Without restarting, your changes won't be applied and you'll continue getting errors.**
