# Fix Applied ✅

## The Problem
The error was caused by an incorrect way of creating a MongoDB ObjectId:
```javascript
// ❌ This doesn't work:
const mockParentId = new require('mongoose').Types.ObjectId();
```

## The Fix
Changed to:
```javascript
// ✅ This works:
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const mockParentId = new mongoose.Types.ObjectId();
```

## Next Steps

**Restart the backend server** to apply the fix:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
npm start
```

Then try adding a student again - it should work now! 🎉
