# Debug Instructions

## What I Added

I've added comprehensive debug logging to help identify where the "Required roles: parent" error is coming from.

## How to Debug

1. **Restart your backend server**
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C if running)
   npm start
   ```

2. **Try adding a student again** from the teacher dashboard

3. **Check the server console logs** - you should see:
   - `teacherCheck - User role: teacher` (should appear)
   - `parentCheck - User role: ...` (might also appear - this would show us the conflict)
   - `=== POST /students route handler called ===`
   - `POST /students - User: ...`
   
4. **Copy the full error and logs** and share them with me

## What We're Looking For

The debug logs will tell us:
- Whether `teacherCheck` middleware is being called
- Whether `parentCheck` middleware is being called (which shouldn't happen)
- Which route is actually being hit
- What the user role is at each step

This will help identify where the "Required roles: parent" error is actually coming from.
