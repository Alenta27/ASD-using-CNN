## 🔐 Clinical Guidelines Embedded

### Evidence-Based Standards
All responses follow established clinical practices:
- ✅ ABA: 20-40 hrs/week gold standard for moderate-severe
- ✅ Early intervention: Screen by age 2, intervene by age 3
- ✅ Neurodiversity-affirming language: "child with autism" preferred
- ✅ Family-centered care: Parents as co-therapists
- ✅ Data-driven tracking: Frequency, duration, quality metrics

### Tone & Communication
- ✅ Empathetic and supportive (not directive)
- ✅ Evidence-based (cites standards like ABA, evidence-based practices)
- ✅ Actionable (includes specific next steps)
- ✅ Professional (appropriate for clinical setting)
- ✅ Neurodiversity-affirming (positive framing)

### Limitations Built In
- Responses start with: "This is guidance, not prescription"
- Explicitly states: "This tool is for support only"
- Recommends consulting with supervisors/colleagues for complex cases
- No medical diagnosis capability
- No emergency medical guidance

---

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### State Management
```javascript
const [showAssistant, setShowAssistant] = useState(false);      // Widget visibility
const [assistantMessages, setAssistantMessages] = useState([]); // Conversation history
const [assistantInput, setAssistantInput] = useState('');       // Current user input
```

### Keyword-Matching Engine
```javascript
const generateAssistantResponse = (input) => {
  // Iterates through therapyGuidance domains
  // Matches user input against trigger keywords
  // Returns pre-composed response
  // Falls back to "available topics" list if no match
}
```

### Response Flow
1. User enters query → `handleAssistantSend()`
2. Query added to message history (user message)
3. `generateAssistantResponse()` matches keywords
4. Bot response generated and added to history
5. Container scrolls to show latest message
6. Input field cleared

### Performance
- ✅ Instant response (no API calls, local keyword matching)
- ✅ Lightweight (pre-composed responses, no AI inference)
- ✅ Memory efficient (messages stored in component state)
- ✅ Responsive UI (CSS animations, smooth transitions)
