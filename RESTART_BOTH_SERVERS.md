# Fix for Appointment Booking 404 Error

## Problem
The backend endpoint `/api/parent/appointments` exists and works correctly, but the frontend is getting a 404 error.

## Root Cause
The endpoint is verified to exist and work (returns 401 when tested directly). The issue is likely:
- Browser cache
- Service worker cache
- Old build being served

## Solution

### Step 1: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache"
4. Hard refresh: Ctrl + Shift + R (or Ctrl + F5)

### Step 2: Clear Application Cache
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Click "Clear storage"
4. Check all boxes
5. Click "Clear site data"

### Step 3: Restart Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
# Kill the process on port 3000
# Then restart:
npm start
```

### Step 4: Restart Backend (if needed)
```bash
cd backend
# Kill the process on port 5000
# Then restart:
npm start
```

## Verification

The endpoint has been verified to work correctly:
- Route exists: `POST /api/parent/appointments`
- Returns 401 (Unauthorized) when no token provided
- CORS is configured correctly
- All routes are properly mounted

The frontend code is also correct - it's sending the request to the right URL with proper headers.

## Additional Notes

If the issue persists after clearing cache, check:
1. Browser console for any service worker messages
2. Network tab to see the actual request URL being sent
3. Any browser extensions that might be interfering with requests
