## 💾 Database Integration

### Models Used
```
User
├── status (pending/approved/rejected)
├── role (therapist/parent/admin/teacher)
├── email
└── username

Patient
├── name
├── age
├── gender
├── parent_id (reference)
├── screeningStatus
├── reportStatus
└── riskLevel

Screening
├── patientId
├── results
└── timestamps

Report
├── patientId
├── content
└── timestamps
```

### Query Patterns
```
1. Find pending therapists
   User.find({ role: 'therapist', status: 'pending' })

2. Get children with screening data
   Patient.find()
   .populate('parent_id', 'username email')
   .then populate Screening and Report

3. Filter children by parent
   Patient.find({ parent_id: parentId })

4. Count notifications
   User.countDocuments({ status: 'pending' })
   Patient.countDocuments({ screeningStatus: 'pending' })
```
