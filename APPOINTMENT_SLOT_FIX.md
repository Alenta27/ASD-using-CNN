# Appointment Slot Availability Fix

## Problem Summary
Parents were unable to see available appointment slots created by therapists, even though the slots existed in the database. The form showed "No available slots for this therapist on the selected date" with `appointmentTime` validation error.

## Root Cause
**Timezone Mismatch in Date Parsing**

When a date is selected from an HTML date picker, it's sent as a string in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (e.g., `"2025-11-30"`). The backend was incorrectly parsing this date using:

```javascript
const requestedDate = new Date(date);  // ❌ Treated as UTC
const startOfDay = new Date(requestedDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0));  // ❌ Converted to local time
```

**Example of the problem:**
- User selects: `2025-11-30` (local date)
- Backend does: `new Date("2025-11-30")` → Nov 30, 2025 00:00:00 **UTC**
- If user is in UTC+5: This becomes Nov 29, 2025 19:00:00 **local time**
- Backend searches for slots on: Nov 29 (wrong date!)
- Result: No slots found, even though they exist for Nov 30

## Solution
Changed all date parsing to treat date strings as local dates:

```javascript
// ✅ Correct approach - Parse as local date
const [year, month, day] = date.split('-').map(Number);
const startOfDay = new Date(year, month - 1, day, 0, 0, 0, 0);
const endOfDay = new Date(year, month - 1, day, 23, 59, 59, 999);
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/backend/routes/parent.js`
- **Line 12-25**: Fixed `/api/parent/available-slots-public` endpoint
- **Line 114-128**: Fixed `/api/parent/available-slots` endpoint  
- **Line 416-418**: Fixed appointment date parsing when booking

### 2. `/backend/routes/therapist.js`
- **Line 372-374**: Fixed slot creation date parsing
- **Line 448-450**: Fixed `/api/therapist/slots/available` endpoint

## Testing the Fix

1. **Therapist creates a slot:**
   - Go to Therapist → Slot Management
   - Create a slot for a specific date (e.g., 2025-11-30)
   - Verify slot is saved in database with correct date

2. **Parent books appointment:**
   - Go to Parent → Appointments
   - Click "Book Appointment"
   - Select same therapist and date
   - **Expected result**: Available time slots should now appear

3. **Verify the form:**
   - Debug info should show: `Available Slots: [number > 0]`
   - Time slots should be selectable
   - Form submission should work without validation errors

## Impact
- ✅ Parents can now see all available slots created by therapists
- ✅ Appointment booking form works correctly
- ✅ Timezone-independent date handling across all endpoints
- ✅ No database changes required

## Database Note
All existing slots in the database should work correctly after this fix without any migration needed. The issue was purely in the date comparison logic.
