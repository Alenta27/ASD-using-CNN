# KNN Model - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd d:\ASD\backend
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Server
```bash
npm start
# Server will automatically load CALTECH dataset
# Wait for: ✅ Loaded [X] samples from CALTECH dataset for KNN
```

### Step 3: Access KNN Model
1. Go to Researcher Dashboard
2. Add "KNN Prediction" to navigation (or navigate to `/research/knn`)
3. Start making predictions!

## 📊 What the Model Does

**Predicts ASD vs Control** using 12 clinical features:
- IQ scores (FIQ, VIQ, PIQ)
- Developmental history (ADI-R scores)
- Clinical observations (ADOS scores)
- Screening questionnaires (SRS, AQ)

**Model Performance**: ~82% accuracy on test data

---

## 🎯 Using the Model

### Quick Input Example (Control/Typical):
```
Age: 25 years
FIQ: 110, VIQ: 115, PIQ: 105
ADI-R Social: 2, Verbal: 3, RRB: 1
ADOS Total: 3, Comm: 1, Social: 2
SRS: 35, AQ: 12
```
→ **Prediction: CONTROL** (Typical Development)

### Quick Input Example (ASD):
```
Age: 28 years
FIQ: 95, VIQ: 88, PIQ: 102
ADI-R Social: 24, Verbal: 18, RRB: 12
ADOS Total: 18, Comm: 8, Social: 10
SRS: 95, AQ: 35
```
→ **Prediction: ASD** (Autism Spectrum Disorder)

## 📈 Understanding Results

### Confidence Score
- **80%+**: Highly confident prediction
- **60-80%**: Moderate confidence
- **<60%**: Low confidence, consider additional testing

### K-Nearest Neighbors Visualization
Shows which k=5 (or your chosen k) training samples were most similar:
- **Red**: ASD cases
- **Green**: Control cases

### Confusion Matrix Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision**: How often ASD predictions are correct
- **Recall**: How many ASD cases are detected
- **F1**: Balanced performance measure

## 🎓 Understanding KNN

**How it works:**
1. New patient data enters
2. System finds k most similar patients from dataset
3. Counts their diagnoses
4. Majority vote = prediction

**Example with k=5:**
- 3 neighbors = ASD
- 2 neighbors = Control
→ **Prediction: ASD** (Confidence: 60%)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ✓ Predictions require valid clinical data
- ✓ Results are based on CALTECH dataset (139 samples)
- ✓ Should supplement, not replace, clinical diagnosis
- ✓ All data processing is anonymized
- ✓ Best used as screening/research tool

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "Dataset not loaded yet" | Wait 5 seconds, refresh page |
| Predictions look wrong | Check if IQ scores are realistic (50-150) |
| API Error | Ensure backend is running on port 5000 |
| No confidence shown | Check browser console for errors |

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Use valid ranges** for features
2. **Fill all 12 fields** for best accuracy
3. **Try different K values** to see impact (5-7 is optimal)
4. **Review the neighbors** to understand the prediction
5. **Download results** for documentation
