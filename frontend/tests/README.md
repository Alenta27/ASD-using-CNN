## Configuration

Tests are configured in `playwright.config.js`:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:3000`
- Browser: Chromium
- Retries: 0 (2 on CI)
- Screenshots: On failure
- Videos: On failure

## Test Reports

After running tests, view the HTML report:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

Screenshots and videos are saved in `test-results/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

### Tests failing due to timeouts
- Ensure both frontend and backend servers are running
- Check that the database is accessible
- Increase timeout values in test files if needed

### Login tests failing
- Verify test credentials are correct in the database
- Check that the backend authentication endpoint is working
- Ensure CORS is properly configured

### Dashboard tests failing
- Verify user roles are correctly assigned in the database
- Check that dashboard routes are properly protected
- Ensure JWT tokens are being generated correctly

## Adding New Tests

1. Create a new test file in the appropriate directory
2. Import necessary utilities from `test-utils.js`
3. Use the provided test credentials or add new ones
4. Follow the existing test patterns for consistency

## Best Practices

1. Always clear storage before each test
2. Use appropriate wait times for async operations
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Group related tests in describe blocks
5. Clean up after tests (logout, clear data if needed)
