## 🎓 How It Works

### Algorithm Flow
```
1. NEW PATIENT DATA ENTERS
   ↓
2. NORMALIZE FEATURES (Min-Max: 0-1)
   ↓
3. CALCULATE EUCLIDEAN DISTANCE TO ALL TRAINING SAMPLES
   Distance = √(Σ(feature_normalized)²)
   ↓
4. SORT BY DISTANCE AND SELECT K NEAREST NEIGHBORS
   ↓
5. COUNT DIAGNOSIS VOTES
   - Count ASD neighbors
   - Count Control neighbors
   ↓
6. MAJORITY VOTE = PREDICTION
   If ASD count > Control count → ASD
   Otherwise → Control
   ↓
7. CALCULATE CONFIDENCE = (max_count / k) × 100
   ↓
8. RETURN PREDICTION + CONFIDENCE + NEIGHBOR DETAILS
```

### Example: k=5
```
New patient sample: [30, 100, 100, 100, ...]

Find 5 nearest neighbors:
1. Patient A (ASD)     - Distance: 0.12
2. Patient B (Control) - Distance: 0.18
3. Patient C (ASD)     - Distance: 0.25
4. Patient D (ASD)     - Distance: 0.31
5. Patient E (Control) - Distance: 0.41

Vote Count:
- ASD: 3
- Control: 2

Prediction: ASD
Confidence: 60% (3/5)
```
