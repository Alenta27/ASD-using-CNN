## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Table looks wrong
**Solution**: Check that Tailwind CSS is properly configured
```bash
npm run build  # Rebuild Tailwind
```

### Issue: Icons not showing
**Solution**: Make sure react-icons is installed
```bash
npm install react-icons
```

### Issue: Page appears empty
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify API endpoint is correct
- Verify token is in localStorage

### Issue: Detail pane doesn't show when clicking row
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors
- Make sure `selectedChild` state is updating
- Verify child object has all required fields

## 💾 Dependencies Already Installed

These are already in your project:
- ✅ `react-icons` - For icons
- ✅ `react-router-dom` - For navigation
- ✅ `tailwindcss` - For styling

## 🎓 Key Concepts Used

### CSS Classes
- `flex`, `flex-col`, `flex-row`: Flexbox layouts
- `grid`, `grid-cols-1`, `lg:grid-cols-3`: Grid layouts
- `gap-4`, `p-6`: Spacing
- `rounded-lg`, `rounded-full`: Border radius
- `shadow-md`: Shadows
- `hover:`, `transition-`: Interactive effects
- `border`, `border-gray-200`: Borders
- `bg-gradient-to-r`: Gradients

### React Patterns
- `useState()`: State management
- `useEffect()`: Side effects
- `.map()`: List rendering
- Ternary operators: Conditional rendering
- Arrow functions: Event handlers

---

## 🚀 Performance

- **Load Time**: Optimized with proper CSS classes
- **Rendering**: Efficient with React best practices
- **Search/Filter**: Client-side (fast, suitable for <5000 items)
- **Scrolling**: Smooth with proper overflow handling

---

## ♿ Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through buttons and inputs
- **Focus States**: Visible outline when focused
- **Color Contrast**: All text meets WCAG standards
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of elements and ARIA where needed

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

| Screen Size | Layout |
|-------------|--------|
| Mobile (<768px) | Controls stack, Master only visible |
| Tablet (768-1024px) | Master-Detail side by side |
| Desktop (>1024px) | Full layout with optimal spacing |
