## 📱 Responsive Behavior

### Mobile (<640px)
- Controls stack vertically
- Search full width
- Filter button below search
- Table scrolls horizontally

### Tablet (640-1024px)
- Controls side-by-side
- Table scrolls horizontally if needed
- Good balance of space

### Desktop (>1024px)
- Full width layout
- Table fully visible
- All columns readable without scrolling

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Mock Data Only**: Currently uses hardcoded test data
2. **No Real Backend**: Download, Delete actions don't persist
3. **No Pagination**: Works with small datasets (<100 records)
4. **No Sorting**: Column headers aren't clickable
5. **No Export**: Can't export screening data to CSV
6. **No Bulk Actions**: Can't delete multiple at once

## ✨ Next Steps to Production

1. **Wire up API calls** (see backend integration guide)
2. **Create detail page** at `/admin/screenings/:id`
3. **Create edit page** at `/admin/screenings/:id/edit`
4. **Add loading spinners** during API calls
5. **Add success notifications** after delete
6. **Add error handling** with helpful messages
7. **Test with real data** from database
8. **Performance test** with 1000+ records
9. **Add sorting** to table columns
10. **Add pagination** for large datasets

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Search doesn't work
- Check that search term is in childName, parentName, or type fields
- Verify `filteredScreenings` is used in table (not `screenings`)
- Check browser console for errors

### Filter modal doesn't appear
- Click "Filter" button
- Check z-index (set to z-50 - should overlay table)
- Look for modal in browser DevTools

### Actions don't trigger
- For View/Edit: Routes may not exist yet (create `/admin/screenings/:id`)
- For Download: Backend endpoint needed
- For Delete: Check browser console for API errors

### Styling looks wrong
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Verify Tailwind CSS is loading
- Check for CSS conflicts in DevTools
