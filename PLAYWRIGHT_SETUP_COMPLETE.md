## 📚 Documentation

### Key Files to Review
1. **`PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_GUIDE.md`** - Comprehensive testing guide
2. **`playwright.config.js`** - Configuration settings
3. **`tests/utils/test-helpers.js`** - Helper functions
4. **`tests/fixtures/test-data.js`** - Test data

### Next Steps
1. **Start your application**: Make sure both frontend and backend are running
2. **Run a test**: Try `npm run test:e2e:headed` to see tests in action
3. **Customize tests**: Modify test files to match your specific UI elements
4. **Add more tests**: Create additional test files for new features

## 🔧 Customization

### Updating Test Selectors
The tests use generic selectors. You'll need to update them to match your actual UI:

```javascript
// Update these selectors in your test files
await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');  // Add data-testid to your buttons
await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');  // Match your form field names
```

### Adding New Tests
```javascript
// Create new test files in tests/ directory
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('your new test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/your-page');
  await expect(page.locator('your-selector')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your Playwright testing setup is complete and ready to use. The tests will help ensure your ASD application works correctly across different browsers and devices.

**Start testing now:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

Happy testing! 🚀
